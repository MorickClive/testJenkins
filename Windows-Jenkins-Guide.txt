Examples - Try it out!

=========================
Here's some sample directions you can take towards building confidence with Jenkins:

    - Try to set up a new job that targets a git repository, performing a successful Maven goal(e.g test, package, validate) after a build. (Hint: you will want to start in the job config settings)
	- Try to set up a job that polls a git repository using scm polling in the job configuration.
	- If you can, use this build pipeline to forward your build generated jar to a nexus server, or use a text file to update an Apache2 Ubtuntu Webserver.

Completing any above example should give you a working understanding of Jenkins potential and familiarise you with how to work with a standard pipeline!
If not, don't worry; research anything that you're stuck on; knowing about builds and how they can moderate project builds will put you in good stead with the workflow.

	Some considerations:
	- A Windows version may require Jenkins/Manage Jenkins/Global Tools/Global Tool Configuration/JDK setup.
	- You may also need to associate Maven with Jenkins.
	- Don't forget to stop the Jenkins instance if you are no longer using it.
